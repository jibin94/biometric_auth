## Biometric Authentication
Biometric authentication is a type of multi-factor authentication (MFA) that uses data derived from a device user’s biological traits, such as facial characteristics, voice recognition, and fingerprints, to facilitate access and better secure personal information and sensitive assets.

### Advantage
- Verification of the user is fully conducted locally on a physical device, removing the possibility of sensitive information being transmitted and potentially exposed via third-party servers.
- Aside from effectively verifying users’ identities, it also serves as an additional layer of security over traditional sign-in methods like password credentials.
